His shop, a crooked timber building with a single brass bell above the door, smelled of oil, sawdust, and the faint tang of rust. Elias was old now—his hair a shock of white, his hands steady but slow—and the villagers came to him not for new clocks but to mend the ones that had stopped telling the truth. One autumn evening, as the sun bled orange across the sky, Elias found the gear. It lay half-buried in a crate of scrap he’d bought from a traveling tinker for a handful of copper. The gear was small, no larger than a coin, but perfect: teeth sharp as a cat’s, metal the color of storm clouds. When he held it to the lamplight, it caught the glow and threw it back wrong—backwards, as if the light itself had reversed. Curious, he fitted it into an old pocket watch whose hands had frozen at 3:17 for twenty years. The moment the gear clicked into place, the watch sighed. Not a mechanical sigh, but something deeper, like a sleeper exhaling after a long-held breath. The hands trembled, then began to move—counterclockwise."
